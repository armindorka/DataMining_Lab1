# DataMining_Lab1
This is the 1st Lab of the Data Mining course at my home university.
All detailed descriptions are to be found in the task files.

libraries: numpy, counter, sklearn
objectives: 
- Random Forest algorithm, 
- creation of bootstrap sample, 
- prediction of labels, 
- computing various kernels (linear, polynomial, rbf and sigmoid), 
- find the best kernel by single validation split, 
- find the best SVM parameter
- use Naive Bayes classifier
- compute log probability
- predict class labels
- initialize nested cross-validator
- perform nested cross-validation
- calculate performance measures
